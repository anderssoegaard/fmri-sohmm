Give	_
that	_
here	_
Malfoy	_
said	_
Harry	_
quietly	_

Everyone	_
stopped	_
talking	_
to	_
watch	_

Malfoy	_
smiled	_
nastily	_

I	_
think	_
I'll	_
leave	_
it	_
somewhere	_
for	_
Longbottom	_
to	_
find	_
how	_
about	_
up	_
a	_
tree	_

Give	_
it	_
here	_

Harry	_
yelled	_
but	_
Malfoy	_
had	_
leapt	_
onto	_
his	_
broomstick	_
and	_
taken	_
off	_

He	_
hadn't	_
been	_
lying	_
he	_
could	_
fly	_
well	_

Hovering	_
level	_
with	_
the	_
topmost	_
branches	_
of	_
an	_
oak	_
he	_
called	_
Come	_
and	_
get	_
it	_
Potter	_

Harry	_
grabbed	_
his	_
broom	_

No	_

shouted	_
Hermione	_
Granger	_

Madam	_
Hooch	_
told	_
us	_
not	_
to	_
move	_
you'll	_
get	_
us	_
all	_
into	_
trouble	_

Harry	_
ignored	_
her	_

Blood	_
was	_
pounding	_
in	_
his	_
ears	_

He	_
mounted	_
the	_
broom	_
and	_
kicked	_
hard	_
against	_
the	_
ground	_
and	_
up	_
up	_
he	_
soared	_
air	_
rushed	_
through	_
his	_
hair	_
and	_
his	_
robes	_
whipped	_
out	_
behind	_
him	_
and	_
in	_
a	_
rush	_
of	_
fierce	_
joy	_
he	_
realized	_
he'd	_
found	_
something	_
he	_
could	_
do	_
without	_
being	_
taught	_
this	_
was	_
easy	_
this	_
was	_
wonderful	_

He	_
pulled	_
his	_
broomstick	_
up	_
a	_
little	_
to	_
take	_
it	_
even	_
higher	_
and	_
heard	_
screams	_
and	_
gasps	_
of	_
girls	_
back	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
and	_
an	_
admiring	_
whoop	_
from	_
Ron	_

He	_
turned	_
his	_
broomstick	_
sharply	_
to	_
face	_
Malfoy	_
in	_
midair	_

Malfoy	_
looked	_
stunned	_

Give	_
it	_
here	_
Harry	_
called	_
or	_
I'll	_
knock	_
you	_
off	_
that	_
broom	_

Oh	_
yeah	_

said	_
Malfoy	_
trying	_
to	_
sneer	_
but	_
looking	_
worried	_

Harry	_
knew	_
somehow	_
what	_
to	_
do	_

He	_
leaned	_
forward	_
and	_
grasped	_
the	_
broom	_
tightly	_
in	_
both	_
hands	_
and	_
it	_
shot	_
toward	_
Malfoy	_
like	_
a	_
javelin	_

Malfoy	_
only	_
just	_
got	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
way	_
in	_
time	_
Harry	_
made	_
a	_
sharp	_
about-face	_
and	_
held	_
the	_
broom	_
steady	_

A	_
few	_
people	_
below	_
were	_
clapping	_

No	_
Crabbe	_
and	_
Goyle	_
up	_
here	_
to	_
save	_
your	_
neck	_
Malfoy	_
Harry	_
called	_

The	_
same	_
thought	_
seemed	_
to	_
have	_
struck	_
Malfoy	_

Catch	_
it	_
if	_
you	_
can	_
then	_

he	_
shouted	_
and	_
he	_
threw	_
the	_
glass	_
ball	_
high	_
into	_
the	_
air	_
and	_
streaked	_
back	_
toward	_
the	_
ground	_

Harry	_
saw	_
as	_
though	_
in	_
slow	_
motion	_
the	_
ball	_
rise	_
up	_
in	_
the	_
air	_
and	_
then	_
start	_
to	_
fall	_

He	_
leaned	_
forward	_
and	_
pointed	_
his	_
broom	_
handle	_
down	_
next	_
second	_
he	_
was	_
gathering	_
speed	_
in	_
a	_
steep	_
dive	_
racing	_
the	_
ball	_
wind	_
whistled	_
in	_
his	_
ears	_
mingled	_
with	_
the	_
screams	_
of	_
people	_
watching	_
he	_
stretched	_
out	_
his	_
hand	_
a	_
foot	_
from	_
the	_
ground	_
he	_
caught	_
it	_
just	_
in	_
time	_
to	_
pull	_
his	_
broom	_
straight	_
and	_
he	_
toppled	_
gently	_
onto	_
the	_
grass	_
with	_
the	_
Remembrall	_
clutched	_
safely	_
in	_
his	_
fist	_

HARRY	_
POTTER	_

His	_
heart	_
sank	_
faster	_
than	_
he'd	_
just	_
dived	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
was	_
running	_
toward	_
them	_

He	_
got	_
to	_
his	_
feet	_
trembling	_

Never	_
in	_
all	_
my	_
time	_
at	_
Hogwarts	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
was	_
almost	_
speechless	_
with	_
shock	_
and	_
her	_
glasses	_
flashed	_
furiously	_
how	_
dare	_
you	_
might	_
have	_
broken	_
your	_
neck	_
It	_
wasn't	_
his	_
fault	_
Professor	_
Be	_
quiet	_
Miss	_
Patil	_
But	_
Malfoy	_
That's	_
enough	_
Mr.	_
Weasley	_

Potter	_
follow	_
me	_
now	_

Harry	_
caught	_
sight	_
of	_
Malfoy	_
Crabbe	_
and	_
Goyle's	_
triumphant	_
faces	_
as	_
he	_
left	_
walking	_
numbly	_
in	_
Professor	_
McGonagall's	_
wake	_
as	_
she	_
strode	_
toward	_
the	_
castle	_

He	_
was	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
expelled	_
he	_
just	_
knew	_
it	_

He	_
wanted	_
to	_
say	_
something	_
to	_
defend	_
himself	_
but	_
there	_
seemed	_
to	_
be	_
something	_
wrong	_
with	_
his	_
voice	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
was	_
sweeping	_
along	_
without	_
even	_
looking	_
at	_
him	_
he	_
had	_
to	_
jog	_
to	_
keep	_
up	_

Now	_
he'd	_
done	_
it	_

He	_
hadn't	_
even	_
lasted	_
two	_
weeks	_

He'd	_
be	_
packing	_
his	_
bags	_
in	_
ten	_
minutes	_

What	_
would	_
the	_
Dursleys	_
say	_
when	_
he	_
turned	_
up	_
on	_
the	_
doorstep	_

Up	_
the	_
front	_
steps	_
up	_
the	_
marble	_
staircase	_
inside	_
and	_
still	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
didn't	_
say	_
a	_
word	_
to	_
him	_

She	_
wrenched	_
open	_
doors	_
and	_
marched	_
along	_
corridors	_
with	_
Harry	_
trotting	_
miserably	_
behind	_
her	_

Maybe	_
she	_
was	_
taking	_
him	_
to	_
Dumbledore	_

He	_
thought	_
of	_
Hagrid	_
expelled	_
but	_
allowed	_
to	_
stay	_
on	_
as	_
gamekeeper	_

Perhaps	_
he	_
could	_
be	_
Hagrid's	_
assistant	_

His	_
stomach	_
twisted	_
as	_
he	_
imagined	_
it	_
watching	_
Ron	_
and	_
the	_
others	_
becoming	_
wizards	_
while	_
he	_
stumped	_
around	_
the	_
grounds	_
carrying	_
Hagrid's	_
bag	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
stopped	_
outside	_
a	_
classroom	_

She	_
opened	_
the	_
door	_
and	_
poked	_
her	_
head	_
inside	_

Excuse	_
me	_
Professor	_
Flitwick	_
could	_
I	_
borrow	_
Wood	_
for	_
a	_
moment	_

Wood	_

thought	_
Harry	_
bewildered	_
was	_
Wood	_
a	_
cane	_
she	_
was	_
going	_
to	_
use	_
on	_
him	_

But	_
Wood	_
turned	_
out	_
to	_
be	_
a	_
person	_
a	_
burly	_
fifth-year	_
boy	_
who	_
came	_
out	_
of	_
Flitwick's	_
class	_
looking	_
confused	_

Follow	_
me	_
you	_
two	_
said	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
and	_
they	_
marched	_
on	_
up	_
the	_
corridor	_
Wood	_
looking	_
curiously	_
at	_
Harry	_

In	_
here	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
pointed	_
them	_
into	_
a	_
classroom	_
that	_
was	_
empty	_
except	_
for	_
Peeves	_
who	_
was	_
busy	_
writing	_
rude	_
words	_
on	_
the	_
blackboard	_

Out	_
Peeves	_

she	_
barked	_

Peeves	_
threw	_
the	_
chalk	_
into	_
a	_
bin	_
which	_
clanged	_
loudly	_
and	_
he	_
swooped	_
out	_
cursing	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
slammed	_
the	_
door	_
behind	_
him	_
and	_
turned	_
to	_
face	_
the	_
two	_
boys	_

Potter	_
this	_
is	_
Oliver	_
Wood	_

Wood	_
I've	_
found	_
you	_
a	_
Seeker	_

Wood's	_
expression	_
changed	_
from	_
puzzlement	_
to	_
delight	_

Are	_
you	_
serious	_
Professor	_

Absolutely	_
said	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
crisply	_

The	_
boy's	_
a	_
natural	_

I've	_
never	_
seen	_
anything	_
like	_
it	_

Was	_
that	_
your	_
first	_
time	_
on	_
a	_
broomstick	_
Potter	_

Harry	_
nodded	_
silently	_

He	_
didn't	_
have	_
a	_
clue	_
what	_
was	_
going	_
on	_
but	_
he	_
didn't	_
seem	_
to	_
be	_
being	_
expelled	_
and	_
some	_
of	_
the	_
feeling	_
started	_
coming	_
back	_
to	_
his	_
legs	_

He	_
caught	_
that	_
thing	_
in	_
his	_
hand	_
after	_
a	_
fifty-foot	_
dive	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
told	_
Wood	_

Didn't	_
even	_
scratch	_
himself	_

Charlie	_
Weasley	_
couldn't	_
have	_
done	_
it	_

Wood	_
was	_
now	_
looking	_
as	_
though	_
all	_
his	_
dreams	_
had	_
come	_
true	_
at	_
once	_

Ever	_
seen	_
a	_
game	_
of	_
Quidditch	_
Potter	_

he	_
asked	_
excitedly	_

Wood's	_
captain	_
of	_
the	_
Gryffindor	_
team	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
explained	_

He's	_
just	_
the	_
build	_
for	_
a	_
Seeker	_
too	_
said	_
Wood	_
now	_
walking	_
around	_
Harry	_
and	_
staring	_
at	_
him	_

Light	_
speedy	_
we'll	_
have	_
to	_
get	_
him	_
a	_
decent	_
broom	_
Professor	_
a	_
Nimbus	_
Two	_
Thousand	_
or	_
a	_
Cleansweep	_
Seven	_
I'd	_
say	_

I	_
shall	_
speak	_
to	_
Professor	_
Dumbledore	_
and	_
see	_
if	_
we	_
can't	_
bend	_
the	_
first-year	_
rule	_

Heaven	_
knows	_
we	_
need	_
a	_
better	_
team	_
than	_
last	_
year	_

Flattened	_
in	_
that	_
last	_
match	_
by	_
Slytherin	_
I	_
couldn't	_
look	_
Severus	_
Snape	_
in	_
the	_
face	_
for	_
weeks	_

Professor	_
McGonagall	_
peered	_
sternly	_
over	_
her	_
glasses	_
at	_
Harry	_

I	_
want	_
to	_
hear	_
you're	_
training	_
hard	_
Potter	_
or	_
I	_
may	_
change	_
my	_
mind	_
about	_
punishing	_
you	_

Then	_
she	_
suddenly	_
smiled	_

Your	_
father	_
would	_
have	_
been	_
proud	_
she	_
said	_

He	_
was	_
an	_
excellent	_
Quidditch	_
player	_
himself	_

You're	_
joking	_

It	_
was	_
dinnertime	_

Harry	_
had	_
just	_
finished	_
telling	_
Ron	_
what	_
had	_
happened	_
when	_
he'd	_
left	_
the	_
grounds	_
with	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_

Ron	_
had	_
a	_
piece	_
of	_
steak	_
and	_
kidney	_
pie	_
halfway	_
to	_
his	_
mouth	_
but	_
he'd	_
forgotten	_
all	_
about	_
it	_

Seeker	_

he	_
said	_

But	_
first	_
years	_
never	_
you	_
must	_
be	_
the	_
youngest	_
House	_
player	_
in	_
about	_
a	_
century	_
said	_
Harry	_
shoveling	_
pie	_
into	_
his	_
mouth	_

He	_
felt	_
particularly	_
hungry	_
after	_
the	_
excitement	_
of	_
the	_
afternoon	_

Wood	_
told	_
me	_

Ron	_
was	_
so	_
amazed	_
so	_
impressed	_
he	_
just	_
sat	_
and	_
gaped	_
at	_
Harry	_

I	_
start	_
training	_
next	_
week	_
said	_
Harry	_

Only	_
don't	_
tell	_
anyone	_
Wood	_
wants	_
to	_
keep	_
it	_
a	_
secret	_

Fred	_
and	_
George	_
Weasley	_
now	_
came	_
into	_
the	_
hall	_
spotted	_
Harry	_
and	_
hurried	_
over	_

Well	_
done	_
said	_
George	_
in	_
a	_
low	_
voice	_

Wood	_
told	_
us	_

We're	_
on	_
the	_
team	_
too	_
Beaters	_

I	_
tell	_
you	_
we're	_
going	_
to	_
win	_
that	_
Quidditch	_
Cup	_
for	_
sure	_
this	_
year	_
said	_
Fred	_

We	_
haven't	_
won	_
since	_
Charlie	_
left	_
but	_
this	_
year's	_
team	_
is	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
brilliant	_

You	_
must	_
be	_
good	_
Harry	_
Wood	_
was	_
almost	_
skipping	_
when	_
he	_
told	_
us	_

Anyway	_
we've	_
got	_
to	_
go	_
Lee	_
Jordan	_
reckons	_
he's	_
found	_
a	_
new	_
secret	_
passageway	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
school	_

Bet	_
it's	_
that	_
one	_
behind	_
the	_
statue	_
of	_
Gregory	_
the	_
Smarmy	_
that	_
we	_
found	_
in	_
our	_
first	_
week	_

See	_
you	_

Fred	_
and	_
George	_
had	_
hardly	_
disappeared	_
when	_
someone	_
far	_
less	_
welcome	_
turned	_
up	_
Malfoy	_
flanked	_
by	_
Crabbe	_
and	_
Goyle	_

Having	_
a	_
last	_
meal	_
Potter	_

When	_
are	_
you	_
getting	_
the	_
train	_
back	_
to	_
the	_
Muggles	_

You're	_
a	_
lot	_
braver	_
now	_
that	_
you're	_
back	_
on	_
the	_
ground	_
and	_
you've	_
got	_
your	_
little	_
friends	_
with	_
you	_
said	_
Harry	_
coolly	_

There	_
was	_
of	_
course	_
nothing	_
at	_
all	_
little	_
about	_
Crabbe	_
and	_
Goyle	_
but	_
as	_
the	_
High	_
Table	_
was	_
full	_
of	_
teachers	_
neither	_
of	_
them	_
could	_
do	_
more	_
than	_
crack	_
their	_
knuckles	_
and	_
scowl	_

I'd	_
take	_
you	_
on	_
anytime	_
on	_
my	_
own	_
said	_
Malfoy	_

Tonight	_
if	_
you	_
want	_

Wizard's	_
duel	_

Wands	_
only	_
no	_
contact	_

What's	_
the	_
matter	_

Never	_
heard	_
of	_
a	_
wizard's	_
duel	_
before	_
I	_
suppose	_

Of	_
course	_
he	_
has	_
said	_
Ron	_
wheeling	_
around	_

I'm	_
his	_
second	_
who's	_
yours	_

Malfoy	_
looked	_
at	_
Crabbe	_
and	_
Goyle	_
sizing	_
them	_
up	_

Crabbe	_
he	_
said	_

Midnight	_
all	_
right	_

We'll	_
meet	_
you	_
in	_
the	_
trophy	_
room	_
that's	_
always	_
unlocked	_

When	_
Malfoy	_
had	_
gone	_
Ron	_
and	_
Harry	_
looked	_
at	_
each	_
other	_

What	_
is	_
a	_
wizard's	_
duel	_

said	_
Harry	_

And	_
what	_
do	_
you	_
mean	_
you're	_
my	_
second	_

Well	_
a	_
second's	_
there	_
to	_
take	_
over	_
if	_
you	_
die	_
said	_
Ron	_
casually	_
getting	_
started	_
at	_
last	_
on	_
his	_
cold	_
pie	_

Catching	_
the	_
look	_
on	_
Harry's	_
face	_
he	_
added	_
quickly	_
But	_
people	_
only	_
die	_
in	_
proper	_
duels	_
you	_
know	_
with	_
real	_
wizards	_

The	_
most	_
you	_
and	_
Malfoy'll	_
be	_
able	_
to	_
do	_
is	_
send	_
sparks	_
at	_
each	_
other	_

Neither	_
of	_
you	_
knows	_
enough	_
magic	_
to	_
do	_
any	_
real	_
damage	_

I	_
bet	_
he	_
expected	_
you	_
to	_
refuse	_
anyway	_

And	_
what	_
if	_
I	_
wave	_
my	_
wand	_
and	_
nothing	_
happens	_

Throw	_
it	_
away	_
and	_
punch	_
him	_
on	_
the	_
nose	_
Ron	_
suggested	_

Excuse	_
me	_

They	_
both	_
looked	_
up	_

It	_
was	_
Hermione	_
Granger	_

Can't	_
a	_
person	_
eat	_
in	_
peace	_
in	_
this	_
place	_

said	_
Ron	_

Hermione	_
ignored	_
him	_
and	_
spoke	_
to	_
Harry	_

I	_
couldn't	_
help	_
overhearing	_
what	_
you	_
and	_
Malfoy	_
were	_
saying	_
Bet	_
you	_
could	_
Ron	_
muttered	_

and	_
you	_
mustn't	_
go	_
wandering	_
around	_
the	_
school	_
at	_
night	_
think	_
of	_
the	_
points	_
you'll	_
lose	_
Gryffindor	_
if	_
you're	_
caught	_
and	_
you're	_
bound	_
to	_
be	_

It's	_
really	_
very	_
selfish	_
of	_
you	_

And	_
it's	_
really	_
none	_
of	_
your	_
business	_
said	_
Harry	_

Good-bye	_
said	_
Ron	_

All	_
the	_
same	_
it	_
wasn't	_
what	_
you'd	_
call	_
the	_
perfect	_
end	_
to	_
the	_
day	_
Harry	_
thought	_
as	_
he	_
lay	_
awake	_
much	_
later	_
listening	_
to	_
Dean	_
and	_
Seamus	_
falling	_
asleep	_
(Neville	_
wasn't	_
back	_
from	_
the	_
hospital	_
wing)	_

Ron	_
had	_
spent	_
all	_
evening	_
giving	_
him	_
advice	_
such	_
as	_
If	_
he	_
tries	_
to	_
curse	_
you	_
you'd	_
better	_
dodge	_
it	_
because	_
I	_
can't	_
remember	_
how	_
to	_
block	_
them	_

There	_
was	_
a	_
very	_
good	_
chance	_
they	_
were	_
going	_
to	_
get	_
caught	_
by	_
Filch	_
or	_
Mrs.	_
Norris	_
and	_
Harry	_
felt	_
he	_
was	_
pushing	_
his	_
luck	_
breaking	_
another	_
school	_
rule	_
today	_

On	_
the	_
other	_
hand	_
Malfoy's	_
sneering	_
face	_
kept	_
looming	_
up	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
darkness	_
this	_
was	_
his	_
big	_
chance	_
to	_
beat	_
Malfoy	_
face-to-face	_

He	_
couldn't	_
miss	_
it	_

Half-past	_
eleven	_
Ron	_
muttered	_
at	_
last	_
we'd	_
better	_
go	_

They	_
pulled	_
on	_
their	_
bathrobes	_
picked	_
up	_
their	_
wands	_
and	_
crept	_
across	_
the	_
tower	_
room	_
down	_
the	_
spiral	_
staircase	_
and	_
into	_
the	_
Gryffindor	_
common	_
room	_

A	_
few	_
embers	_
were	_
still	_
glowing	_
in	_
the	_
fireplace	_
turning	_
all	_
the	_
armchairs	_
into	_
hunched	_
black	_
shadows	_

They	_
had	_
almost	_
reached	_
the	_
portrait	_
hole	_
when	_
a	_
voice	_
spoke	_
from	_
the	_
chair	_
nearest	_
them	_
I	_
can't	_
believe	_
you're	_
going	_
to	_
do	_
this	_
Harry	_

A	_
lamp	_
flickered	_
on	_

It	_
was	_
Hermione	_
Granger	_
wearing	_
a	_
pink	_
bathrobe	_
and	_
a	_
frown	_

You	_

said	_
Ron	_
furiously	_

Go	_
back	_
to	_
bed	_

I	_
almost	_
told	_
your	_
brother	_
Hermione	_
snapped	_
Percy	_
he's	_
a	_
prefect	_
he'd	_
put	_
a	_
stop	_
to	_
this	_

Harry	_
couldn't	_
believe	_
anyone	_
could	_
be	_
so	_
interfering	_

Come	_
on	_
he	_
said	_
to	_
Ron	_

He	_
pushed	_
open	_
the	_
portrait	_
of	_
the	_
Fat	_
Lady	_
and	_
climbed	_
through	_
the	_
hole	_

Hermione	_
wasn't	_
going	_
to	_
give	_
up	_
that	_
easily	_

She	_
followed	_
Ron	_
through	_
the	_
portrait	_
hole	_
hissing	_
at	_
them	_
like	_
an	_
angry	_
goose	_

Don't	_
you	_
care	_
about	_
Gryffindor	_
do	_
you	_
only	_
care	_
about	_
yourselves	_
I	_
don't	_
want	_
Slytherin	_
to	_
win	_
the	_
House	_
Cup	_
and	_
you'll	_
lose	_
all	_
the	_
points	_
I	_
got	_
from	_
Professor	_
McGonagall	_
for	_
knowing	_
about	_
Switching	_
Spells	_

Go	_
away	_

All	_
right	_
but	_
I	_
warned	_
you	_
you	_
just	_
remember	_
what	_
I	_
said	_
when	_
you're	_
on	_
the	_
train	_
home	_
tomorrow	_
you're	_
so	_
But	_
what	_
they	_
were	_
they	_
didn't	_
find	_
out	_

Hermione	_
had	_
turned	_
to	_
the	_
portrait	_
of	_
the	_
Fat	_
Lady	_
to	_
get	_
back	_
inside	_
and	_
found	_
herself	_
facing	_
an	_
empty	_
painting	_

The	_
Fat	_
Lady	_
had	_
gone	_
on	_
a	_
nighttime	_
visit	_
and	_
Hermione	_
was	_
locked	_
out	_
of	_
Gryffindor	_
Tower	_

Now	_
what	_
am	_
I	_
going	_
to	_
do	_

she	_
asked	_
shrilly	_

That's	_
your	_
problem	_
said	_
Ron	_

We've	_
got	_
to	_
go	_
we're	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
late	_

They	_
hadn't	_
even	_
reached	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
corridor	_
when	_
Hermione	_
caught	_
up	_
with	_
them	_

I'm	_
coming	_
with	_
you	_
she	_
said	_

You	_
are	_
not	_

D'you	_
think	_
I'm	_
going	_
to	_
stand	_
out	_
here	_
and	_
wait	_
for	_
Filch	_
to	_
catch	_
me	_

If	_
he	_
finds	_
all	_
three	_
of	_
us	_
I'll	_
tell	_
him	_
the	_
truth	_
that	_
I	_
was	_
trying	_
to	_
stop	_
you	_
and	_
you	_
can	_
back	_
me	_
up	_

You've	_
got	_
some	_
nerve	_
said	_
Ron	_
loudly	_

Shut	_
up	_
both	_
of	_
you	_

said	_
Harry	_
sharply	_

I	_
heard	_
something	_

It	_
was	_
a	_
sort	_
of	_
snuffling	_

Mrs.	_
Norris	_

breathed	_
Ron	_
squinting	_
through	_
the	_
dark	_

It	_
wasn't	_
Mrs.	_
Norris	_

It	_
was	_
Neville	_

He	_
was	_
curled	_
up	_
on	_
the	_
floor	_
fast	_
asleep	_
but	_
jerked	_
suddenly	_
awake	_
as	_
they	_
crept	_
nearer	_

Thank	_
goodness	_
you	_
found	_
me	_

I've	_
been	_
out	_
here	_
for	_
hours	_
I	_
couldn't	_
remember	_
the	_
new	_
password	_
to	_
get	_
in	_
to	_
bed	_

Keep	_
your	_
voice	_
down	_
Neville	_

The	_
password's	_
Pig	_
snout'	_
but	_
it	_
won't	_
help	_
you	_
now	_
the	_
Fat	_
Lady's	_
gone	_
off	_
somewhere	_

How's	_
your	_
arm	_

said	_
Harry	_

Fine	_
said	_
Neville	_
showing	_
them	_

Madam	_
Pomfrey	_
mended	_
it	_
in	_
about	_
a	_
minute	_

Good	_
well	_
look	_
Neville	_
we've	_
got	_
to	_
be	_
somewhere	_
we'll	_
see	_
you	_
later	_
Don't	_
leave	_
me	_

said	_
Neville	_
scrambling	_
to	_
his	_
feet	_
I	_
don't	_
want	_
to	_
stay	_
here	_
alone	_
the	_
Bloody	_
Baron's	_
been	_
past	_
twice	_
already	_

Ron	_
looked	_
at	_
his	_
watch	_
and	_
then	_
glared	_
furiously	_
at	_
Hermione	_
and	_
Neville	_

If	_
either	_
of	_
you	_
get	_
us	_
caught	_
I'll	_
never	_
rest	_
until	_
I've	_
learned	_
that	_
Curse	_
of	_
the	_
Bogies	_
Quirrell	_
told	_
us	_
about	_
and	_
used	_
it	_
on	_
you	_

Hermione	_
opened	_
her	_
mouth	_
perhaps	_
to	_
tell	_
Ron	_
exactly	_
how	_
to	_
use	_
the	_
Curse	_
of	_
the	_
Bogies	_
but	_
Harry	_
hissed	_
at	_
her	_
to	_
be	_
quiet	_
and	_
beckoned	_
them	_
all	_
forward	_

They	_
flitted	_
along	_
corridors	_
striped	_
with	_
bars	_
of	_
moonlight	_
from	_
the	_
high	_
windows	_

At	_
every	_
turn	_
Harry	_
expected	_
to	_
run	_
into	_
Filch	_
or	_
Mrs.	_
Norris	_
but	_
they	_
were	_
lucky	_

They	_
sped	_
up	_
a	_
staircase	_
to	_
the	_
third	_
floor	_
and	_
tiptoed	_
toward	_
the	_
trophy	_
room	_

Malfoy	_
and	_
Crabbe	_
weren't	_
there	_
yet	_

The	_
crystal	_
trophy	_
cases	_
glimmered	_
where	_
the	_
moonlight	_
caught	_
them	_

Cups	_
shields	_
plates	_
and	_
statues	_
winked	_
silver	_
and	_
gold	_
in	_
the	_
darkness	_

They	_
edged	_
along	_
the	_
walls	_
keeping	_
their	_
eyes	_
on	_
the	_
doors	_
at	_
either	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
room	_

Harry	_
took	_
out	_
his	_
wand	_
in	_
case	_
Malfoy	_
leapt	_
in	_
and	_
started	_
at	_
once	_

The	_
minutes	_
crept	_
by	_

He's	_
late	_
maybe	_
he's	_
chickened	_
out	_
Ron	_
whispered	_

Then	_
a	_
noise	_
in	_
the	_
next	_
room	_
made	_
them	_
jump	_

Harry	_
had	_
only	_
just	_
raised	_
his	_
wand	_
when	_
they	_
heard	_
someone	_
speak	_
and	_
it	_
wasn't	_
Malfoy	_

Sniff	_
around	_
my	_
sweet	_
they	_
might	_
be	_
lurking	_
in	_
a	_
corner	_

It	_
was	_
Filch	_
speaking	_
to	_
Mrs.	_
Norris	_

Horror-struck	_
Harry	_
waved	_
madly	_
at	_
the	_
other	_
three	_
to	_
follow	_
him	_
as	_
quickly	_
as	_
possible	_
they	_
scurried	_
silently	_
toward	_
the	_
door	_
away	_
from	_
Filch's	_
voice	_

Neville's	_
robes	_
had	_
barely	_
whipped	_
round	_
the	_
corner	_
when	_
they	_
heard	_
Filch	_
enter	_
the	_
trophy	_
room	_

They're	_
in	_
here	_
somewhere	_
they	_
heard	_
him	_
mutter	_
probably	_
hiding	_

This	_
way	_

Harry	_
mouthed	_
to	_
the	_
others	_
and	_
petrified	_
they	_
began	_
to	_
creep	_
down	_
a	_
long	_
gallery	_
full	_
of	_
suits	_
of	_
armor	_

They	_
could	_
hear	_
Filch	_
getting	_
nearer	_

Neville	_
suddenly	_
let	_
out	_
a	_
frightened	_
squeak	_
and	_
broke	_
into	_
a	_
run	_
he	_
tripped	_
grabbed	_
Ron	_
around	_
the	_
waist	_
and	_
the	_
pair	_
of	_
them	_
toppled	_
right	_
into	_
a	_
suit	_
of	_
armor	_

The	_
clanging	_
and	_
crashing	_
were	_
enough	_
to	_
wake	_
the	_
whole	_
castle	_

RUN	_

Harry	_
yelled	_
and	_
the	_
four	_
of	_
them	_
sprinted	_
down	_
the	_
gallery	_
not	_
looking	_
back	_
to	_
see	_
whether	_
Filch	_
was	_
following	_
they	_
swung	_
around	_
the	_
doorpost	_
and	_
galloped	_
down	_
one	_
corridor	_
then	_
another	_
Harry	_
in	_
the	_
lead	_
without	_
any	_
idea	_
where	_
they	_
were	_
or	_
where	_
they	_
were	_
going	_
they	_
ripped	_
through	_
a	_
tapestry	_
and	_
found	_
themselves	_
in	_
a	_
hidden	_
passageway	_
hurtled	_
along	_
it	_
and	_
came	_
out	_
near	_
their	_
Charms	_
classroom	_
which	_
they	_
knew	_
was	_
miles	_
from	_
the	_
trophy	_
room	_

I	_
think	_
we've	_
lost	_
him	_
Harry	_
panted	_
leaning	_
against	_
the	_
cold	_
wall	_
and	_
wiping	_
his	_
forehead	_

Neville	_
was	_
bent	_
double	_
wheezing	_
and	_
spluttering	_

I	_
told	_
you	_
Hermione	_
gasped	_
clutching	_
at	_
the	_
stitch	_
in	_
her	_
chest	_
I	_
told	_
you	_

We've	_
got	_
to	_
get	_
back	_
to	_
Gryffindor	_
Tower	_
said	_
Ron	_
quickly	_
as	_
possible	_

Malfoy	_
tricked	_
you	_
Hermione	_
said	_
to	_
Harry	_

You	_
realize	_
that	_
don't	_
you	_

He	_
was	_
never	_
going	_
to	_
meet	_
you	_
Filch	_
knew	_
someone	_
was	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
in	_
the	_
trophy	_
room	_
Malfoy	_
must	_
have	_
tipped	_
him	_
off	_

Harry	_
thought	_
she	_
was	_
probably	_
right	_
but	_
he	_
wasn't	_
going	_
to	_
tell	_
her	_
that	_

Let's	_
go	_

It	_
wasn't	_
going	_
to	_
be	_
that	_
simple	_

They	_
hadn't	_
gone	_
more	_
than	_
a	_
dozen	_
paces	_
when	_
a	_
doorknob	_
rattled	_
and	_
something	_
came	_
shooting	_
out	_
of	_
a	_
classroom	_
in	_
front	_
of	_
them	_

It	_
was	_
Peeves	_

He	_
caught	_
sight	_
of	_
them	_
and	_
gave	_
a	_
squeal	_
of	_
delight	_

Shut	_
up	_
Peeves	_
please	_
you'll	_
get	_
us	_
thrown	_
out	_

Peeves	_
cackled	_

Wandering	_
around	_
at	_
midnight	_
Ickle	_
Firsties	_

Tut	_
tut	_
tut	_

Naughty	_
naughty	_
you'll	_
get	_
caughty	_

Not	_
if	_
you	_
don't	_
give	_
us	_
away	_
Peeves	_
please	_

Should	_
tell	_
Filch	_
I	_
should	_
said	_
Peeves	_
in	_
a	_
saintly	_
voice	_
but	_
his	_
eyes	_
glittered	_
wickedly	_

It's	_
for	_
your	_
own	_
good	_
you	_
know	_

Get	_
out	_
of	_
the	_
way	_
snapped	_
Ron	_
taking	_
a	_
swipe	_
at	_
Peeves	_
this	_
was	_
a	_
big	_
mistake	_

STUDENTS	_
OUT	_
OF	_
BED	_

Peeves	_
bellowed	_
STUDENTS	_
OUT	_
OF	_
BED	_
DOWN	_
THE	_
CHARMS	_
CORRIDOR	_

Ducking	_
under	_
Peeves	_
they	_
ran	_
for	_
their	_
lives	_
right	_
to	_
the	_
end	_
of	_
the	_
corridor	_
where	_
they	_
slammed	_
into	_
a	_
door	_
and	_
it	_
was	_
locked	_

This	_
is	_
it	_

Ron	_
moaned	_
as	_
they	_
pushed	_
helplessly	_
at	_
the	_
door	_
We're	_
done	_
for	_

This	_
is	_
the	_
end	_

They	_
could	_
hear	_
footsteps	_
Filch	_
running	_
as	_
fast	_
as	_
he	_
could	_
toward	_
Peeves's	_
shouts	_

Oh	_
move	_
over	_
Hermione	_
snarled	_

She	_
grabbed	_
Harry's	_
wand	_
tapped	_
the	_
lock	_
and	_
whispered	_
Alohomora	_

The	_
lock	_
clicked	_
and	_
the	_
door	_
swung	_
open	_
they	_
piled	_
through	_
it	_
shut	_
it	_
quickly	_
and	_
pressed	_
their	_
ears	_
against	_
it	_
listening	_

Which	_
way	_
did	_
they	_
go	_
Peeves	_

Filch	_
was	_
saying	_

Quick	_
tell	_
me	_

Say	_
please'	_
Don't	_
mess	_
with	_
me	_
Peeves	_
now	_
where	_
did	_
they	_
go	_

Shan't	_
say	_
nothing	_
if	_
you	_
don't	_
say	_
please	_
said	_
Peeves	_
in	_
his	_
annoying	_
singsong	_
voice	_

All	_
right	_
please	_

NOTHING	_

Ha	_
haaa	_

Told	_
you	_
I	_
wouldn't	_
say	_
nothing	_
if	_
you	_
didn't	_
say	_
please	_

Ha	_
ha	_

Haaaaaa	_

And	_
they	_
heard	_
the	_
sound	_
of	_
Peeves	_
whooshing	_
away	_
and	_
Filch	_
cursing	_
in	_
rage	_

He	_
thinks	_
this	_
door	_
is	_
locked	_
Harry	_
whispered	_

I	_
think	_
we'll	_
be	_
okay	_
get	_
off	_
Neville	_

For	_
Neville	_
had	_
been	_
tugging	_
on	_
the	_
sleeve	_
of	_
Harry's	_
bathrobe	_
for	_
the	_
last	_
minute	_

What	_

Harry	_
turned	_
around	_
and	_
saw	_
quite	_
clearly	_
what	_

For	_
a	_
moment	_
he	_
was	_
sure	_
he'd	_
walked	_
into	_
a	_
nightmare	_
this	_
was	_
too	_
much	_
on	_
top	_
of	_
everything	_
that	_
had	_
happened	_
so	_
far	_

They	_
weren't	_
in	_
a	_
room	_
as	_
he	_
had	_
supposed	_

They	_
were	_
in	_
a	_
corridor	_

The	_
forbidden	_
corridor	_
on	_
the	_
third	_
floor	_

And	_
now	_
they	_
knew	_
why	_
it	_
was	_
forbidden	_

They	_
were	_
looking	_
straight	_
into	_
the	_
eyes	_
of	_
a	_
monstrous	_
dog	_
a	_
dog	_
that	_
filled	_
the	_
whole	_
space	_
between	_
ceiling	_
and	_
floor	_

It	_
had	_
three	_
heads	_

Three	_
pairs	_
of	_
rolling	_
mad	_
eyes	_
three	_
noses	_
twitching	_
and	_
quivering	_
in	_
their	_
direction	_
three	_
drooling	_
mouths	_
saliva	_
hanging	_
in	_
slippery	_
ropes	_
from	_
yellowish	_
fangs	_

It	_
was	_
standing	_
quite	_
still	_
all	_
six	_
eyes	_
staring	_
at	_
them	_
and	_
Harry	_
knew	_
that	_
the	_
only	_
reason	_
they	_
weren't	_
already	_
dead	_
was	_
that	_
their	_
sudden	_
appearance	_
had	_
taken	_
it	_
by	_
surprise	_
but	_
it	_
was	_
quickly	_
getting	_
over	_
that	_
there	_
was	_
no	_
mistaking	_
what	_
those	_
thunderous	_
growls	_
meant	_

Harry	_
groped	_
for	_
the	_
doorknob	_
between	_
Filch	_
and	_
death	_
he'd	_
take	_
Filch	_

They	_
fell	_
backward	_
Harry	_
slammed	_
the	_
door	_
shut	_
and	_
they	_
ran	_
they	_
almost	_
flew	_
back	_
down	_
the	_
corridor	_

Filch	_
must	_
have	_
hurried	_
off	_
to	_
look	_
for	_
them	_
somewhere	_
else	_
because	_
they	_
didn't	_
see	_
him	_
anywhere	_
but	_
they	_
hardly	_
cared	_
all	_
they	_
wanted	_
to	_
do	_
was	_
put	_
as	_
much	_
space	_
as	_
possible	_
between	_
them	_
and	_
that	_
monster	_

They	_
didn't	_
stop	_
running	_
until	_
they	_
reached	_
the	_
portrait	_
of	_
the	_
Fat	_
Lady	_
on	_
the	_
seventh	_
floor	_

Where	_
on	_
earth	_
have	_
you	_
all	_
been	_

she	_
asked	_
looking	_
at	_
their	_
bathrobes	_
hanging	_
off	_
their	_
shoulders	_
and	_
their	_
flushed	_
sweaty	_
faces	_

Never	_
mind	_
that	_
pig	_
snout	_
pig	_
snout	_
panted	_
Harry	_
and	_
the	_
portrait	_
swung	_
forward	_

They	_
scrambled	_
into	_
the	_
common	_
room	_
and	_
collapsed	_
trembling	_
into	_
armchairs	_

It	_
was	_
a	_
while	_
before	_
any	_
of	_
them	_
said	_
anything	_

Neville	_
indeed	_
looked	_
as	_
if	_
he'd	_
never	_
speak	_
again	_

What	_
do	_
they	_
think	_
they're	_
doing	_
keeping	_
a	_
thing	_
like	_
that	_
locked	_
up	_
in	_
a	_
school	_

said	_
Ron	_
finally	_

If	_
any	_
dog	_
needs	_
exercise	_
that	_
one	_
does	_

Hermione	_
had	_
got	_
both	_
her	_
breath	_
and	_
her	_
bad	_
temper	_
back	_
again	_

You	_
don't	_
use	_
your	_
eyes	_
any	_
of	_
you	_
do	_
you	_

she	_
snapped	_

Didn't	_
you	_
see	_
what	_
it	_
was	_
standing	_
on	_

The	_
floor	_

Harry	_
suggested	_

I	_
wasn't	_
looking	_
at	_
its	_
feet	_
I	_
was	_
too	_
busy	_
with	_
its	_
heads	_

No	_
not	_
the	_
floor	_

It	_
was	_
standing	_
on	_
a	_
trapdoor	_

It's	_
obviously	_
guarding	_
something	_

She	_
stood	_
up	_
glaring	_
at	_
them	_

I	_
hope	_
you're	_
pleased	_
with	_
yourselves	_

We	_
could	_
all	_
have	_
been	_
killed	_
or	_
worse	_
expelled	_

Now	_
if	_
you	_
don't	_
mind	_
I'm	_
going	_
to	_
bed	_

Ron	_
stared	_
after	_
her	_
his	_
mouth	_
open	_

No	_
we	_
don't	_
mind	_
he	_
said	_

You'd	_
think	_
we	_
dragged	_
her	_
along	_
wouldn't	_
you	_

But	_
Hermione	_
had	_
given	_
Harry	_
something	_
else	_
to	_
think	_
about	_
as	_
he	_
climbed	_
back	_
into	_
bed	_

The	_
dog	_
was	_
guarding	_
something	_

What	_
had	_
Hagrid	_
said	_

Gringotts	_
was	_
the	_
safest	_
place	_
in	_
the	_
world	_
for	_
something	_
you	_
wanted	_
to	_
hide	_
except	_
perhaps	_
Hogwarts	_

It	_
looked	_
as	_
though	_
Harry	_
had	_
found	_
out	_
where	_
the	_
grubby	_
little	_
package	_
from	_
vault	_
seven	_
hundred	_
and	_
thirteen	_
was	_
